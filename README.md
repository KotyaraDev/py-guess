# Game Info

Name of the game: "Guess the number"

Description: In this game you have to guess a number that the computer has riddled from 1 to 100. You have only 5 tries to guess the correct answer, and each time you give the wrong answer, the number of your remaining tries is reduced by 1.

Each time you give the wrong answer, the game will give you a hint as to which number is closer to the guessed number - a lower or a higher one. This will help you strive for the right answer and not waste your attempts.

When you guessed the number, the game will congratulate you and show how many tries you have left. If you run out of tries and don't guess the number, the game is over and you lose.

Controls: The game will be run in the Python console. To start the game you need to run the program. You will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 100. When you enter your answer, the game will tell you if it is correct. If your answer is wrong, the game will tell you whether you should enter a smaller or larger number and how many tries you have left. At the end of the game, the game will tell you how many tries you have left and congratulate you if you guessed the number, or declare failure if you ran out of tries.

Good luck in the game!
